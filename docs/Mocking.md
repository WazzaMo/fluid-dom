## Concept

Rather than use browser-based testing which suffers the issues
of browser dependency and slower runtime, it's so much better
if unit tests can be completely predictable and run in NodeJS.

## Getting Started

There's a different build of Fluid DOM that is included in the
NPM package for mocking.
